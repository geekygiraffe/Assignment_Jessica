% Vector form of the equation of a line R = r +tv = (x, y, z) + t(a,b,c)
% tv = vector that lies along the line and expresses how far from the
% origianl point we shoudl move. if t is positive move away from teh
% original poin in the direction of v if t is negative move away from teh
% oriinal poin in theopposite direction of v.
